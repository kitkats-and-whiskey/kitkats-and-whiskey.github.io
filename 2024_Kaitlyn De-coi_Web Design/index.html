   <h2>About Us</h2>
   <p>Our journey begins with a dedication to sustainable practices. From sourcing local, organic ingredients to minimizing waste through composting and recycling, we strive to leave the lightest ecological footprint possible. We partner with local farmers and producers to ensure that our ingredients are not only of the highest quality but also support our community and reduce transportation emissions.</p>
   <p>But our commitment to sustainability doesn't end there. We also have a deep appreciation for the beauty and diversity of nature, which is why we take pride in using natural and native ingredients whenever possible. From the sweet tang of wild berries to the earthy richness of native grains, our menu celebrates the flavors of our land in every bite.</p>
